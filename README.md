# ROBDD_algorithem
This project is about the ROBDD algorithms. So that we can visualize our tree at the end, a program from the University of Bremen is used. The file is created by the algorithm. You just have to start the file with the program from the university. The link for the program can be found here.  http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uDrawGraph/en/index.html
